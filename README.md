# Order Block Identification Script

This Python script identifies order blocks in historical price data for financial markets. Order blocks are areas on a price chart where a large number of orders are placed, potentially affecting the future direction of the price. The script analyzes price action and looks for key levels of support and resistance to identify potential order blocks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Prepare a CSV file containing historical price data with columns labeled 'High' and 'Low', representing the high and low prices for each period (e.g., daily, hourly). Make sure the CSV file has a header row with these column names.

2. Replace the `file_path` variable in the script with the path to your CSV file containing historical price data:

```python
file_path = 'path/to/your/price_data.csv'
```

3. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python order_block_identification.py
```

4. The script will display a plot with the identified order blocks marked by horizontal red and green lines.

## Customization

You can fine-tune the order block identification by adjusting the `window` and `threshold` parameters in the `identify_order_blocks` function:

- `window` (default: 10): Determines how many periods to look back and forward when searching for the highest high and lowest low.
- `threshold` (default: 0.6): A decimal value representing the minimum range of an order block as a proportion of the total price range in the dataset.

Modify these parameters in the script as needed:

```python
blocks = identify_order_blocks(data, window=10, threshold=0.6)
```
